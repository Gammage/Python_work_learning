Chapter intro:
    - handling errors so programs dont crash when encountering unexpected situations
    - learn about exceptions, special objects python creates to manage errors while
    a program runs
    - learn about the json module, allowing to save user data so it isnt lost 
    when program stops running
    - learning to work with files and save data will make programs easier for people
    to use
    - users will be able to choose what data to enter/when to enter it
    - run program, do some work, then close program
    - exceptions handling deal with situations in which files dont exist/deal with
    other problems that cause it to crash
    - make programs more rebust then they encounter bad data
        -innocent mistakes or from malicious attempts

    with the above, this chapter the intention is to make programs more applicable,
    useable and stable.
