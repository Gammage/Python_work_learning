gym_exercises = ['pushup','pullup','squat','chinup','hax squat']
print(f'here is my gym exercise list:{gym_exercises}')
print(f'the first 3 gym exercises in list{gym_exercises[0:3]}')
print(f'three items from the middle of the list{gym_exercises[1:4]}')
print(f'last three items from the list are {gym_exercises[2:]}')
