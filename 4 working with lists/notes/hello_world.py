# unneccessary indent examples

# message = "hello python world"
    # print(message)
    
# indent only when you need to do so. at this point of the book, indents only needed in a for loop

# magicians = ['alice','david','carolina']
# for magician in magicians:
#     print(f'{magician.title()}, great trick!')
    
#     print('thank you everyone, great show')
    
#because the indent it still applies to the for loop
#also, the : colon interpret the next line as the start of a loop. eg

# magicians = ['alice','david','carolina']
# for magician in magicians
#     print(f'{magician.title()}, great trick!')
    
#     print('thank you everyone, great show')
