#use the third argument of the range function to make a list of the odd numbers from 1 to 20

odd_list = list(range(1,20,2))
print(odd_list)
# for number in odd_list:
#     print(number)

even_list = list(range(2,21,2))
print(even_list)

#so in this i have gone over each value in list item in a for loop
#ive also printed the list from the range 1 plus 2 up until 20 (1+2=3,3+2=5,5+2=7)
