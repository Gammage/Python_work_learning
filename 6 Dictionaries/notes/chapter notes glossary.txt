accurately

    -be able to create a dictionary representing a person and store as much

looping through a dictionary:

many_users.py

*NEST LISTS AND dictionaries
    You should not nest lists and dictionaries too deeply. if you're nesting Items
    much deeper then this example then what you see in this example. if theres code
    with significant nesting, theres most likely a simpler way to solve the problem
