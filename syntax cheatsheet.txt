enumerate(): works on lists, gives index number and item.
    EG. for index, value in enumerate(my_list)

.items(): Works on dictionaries, gives key and value.
    EG. for key, value in my_dictionary.items()

.append(): works on lists, add item to the end of a lists.
    EG. current_list.append(new_list)

.update(): works on dictionaries, merges all key-value pairs from other dictionary.
    EG current_dict.update(added_dict)

.sort(): used on LISTS ONLY. permenantly reorder the list
    EG a_list.sort():

.sorted(): used on any iterable list,dict,set. temporarily returns a new sorted version
    EG. print(sorted(a_list_or_dict))

input(): lets the user type anything, and the text inside it guides what they should enter.
    EG: message = input("tell me something, and i will repeat it back to you: ")
        print(message)

int(): convers an input string into a numerical value
    EG: >>> age = input("how old are you?)
        How old are you? 21
        >>> age = int(age)
        >>> age >= 18
        True

type(): tells you what kind of value something is - string, number, list etc.
    EG: >>> name = 'ben'
        >>> print(type(name))
        <class str>

while(): the while loop runs as long as or while, a certian condition is True
    EG >>> while number <= 5
       >>> print(number)
       >>> number += 1
       1
       2
       3
       4
       5

//Operators//
+=: add this to whats already there
    EG: >>> message = "hello"
        >>> message += "world"
        message becomes "hello world"

%: Modulo operator: divides one number to another and gives remainder*.
    EG: >>> 4 % 3
        1
        >>> 5 % 3
        2
        >>> 6 % 3
        0

        *if you want to tell if something is even, there wont be a remainder

Loop-control statements
break: when the loop should stop at a specific moment/statement
    EG: exit loop at specific event
        multiple exit conditions
        simple scripts and input loops

continue: returns to the beginning of the statement, based on conditional test.
ends the current iteration of the loop
    EG: 


Rule of thumb

boolean flag :when the loop resents an ongoing state (Active vs inactive)
    EG: representing a running state
        more readable logic at the top of loop
