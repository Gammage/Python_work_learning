# supposedly bigger dinner table! adding more guests

#using what i learnt, previous list
dinner_people = ['Rob', 'mum', 'Katie']
print('im supposed to inform peeps i have a bigger table in a print function')
print(F'\ninserting a new guest in the beginning of list. current list: {dinner_people}')
dinner_people.insert(0,'BUMMY')
print(f'new list {dinner_people}')
dinner_people.insert(3, 'ben')
print(f'\nInserting a new guest in the Middle of list ={dinner_people} ')
dinner_people.append('alina')
print(dinner_people)

#and the actual test was to print individually...
print(f'invite for first person {dinner_people[0]}')
print(f'print for second {dinner_people[1]}')
print('i get the idea')
