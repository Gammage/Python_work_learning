##example of using int() in a prompt

height = input("how tall are you, in inches")
height = int(height)

if height >= 48:
    print("\nyou're tall enough to enter the ride :)")
else:
    print("\nyou are a short king unlucky")

#when using number inputs to do calculations and comparisons, be sure to conver
#the input value to a numerical representation first
