# string is a series of characters. this file is part of the string chapter pg20

name = "ada lovelace"
print(name.title())

# the title is the method. it acts on the name variable which is ada lovelace,
# its told to do so by the literal dot after the name.
# as the title method doesnt need any other info (capitalises each word in string to title case) it doesn't need any other info in the parenthesis.
# paranthesis always follows a method, methods do usually need more info tho.

name = "ada lovelace"
print(name.upper())
print(name.lower())

# apparently lowercase is good for data storage!
