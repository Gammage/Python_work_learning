#to determine if two values are not equal, we can use the inequality operator
#(!=)

requested_topping = 'mushroom'

if requested_topping != 'anchioves':
    print("hold the anchovies!")
    
#this code compares the value in requested_topping in an if statement to anchioves
#as it was not equal to mushroom the if statement continued to print
#hold the anchovies, because the statement is true: requested_topping mushroom
#is not equal to anchioves.

#most conditional expressions will test for equality, but sometimes checking
#for inequality is more applicable
