# add

#exponents uses two asterisks or multiply symbols
#exponent/index is the small number above and right of the base number. remmeber i would say in the below example 3 to the power of 2
#so below would be 9. 3 x 3. 
print(3 ** 2)

#3 to the power of 3 would be 3 x 3 x 3 so 27. i suck at simple math.
print(f'3 to the power of 3 example: {3 ** 3}')

#python supports the order of operations too (bodmas)
print(f'order of operations answer: {2 + 3 * 4}')
