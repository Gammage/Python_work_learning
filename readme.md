This is a learning repo to better understand code (and get serious with it, in the hopes of changing career paths) made public for the world to see!

In particular, all the "programs" are a result of following Eric matthews book "Python Crash course" which you can find [here on amazon](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/1718502702?ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_fed_asin_title) if you plan to learn yourself, I advise not looking at my files - thats cheating!

for those interested in my progress, watch me struggle on [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/benjamin_gammage)!
